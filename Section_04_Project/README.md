# Section 4 - Starting a New Project

Here we are going to walk through setting up a new project using Android Studio. This is broken into multiple sections. All code samples can be found in the [Sample_Code folder](./Sample_Code)

# Important Disclaimers
* Here are the settings this project was built with
    * Using Android Studio 2.3.2
    * NDK r14
    * Android API 23
        * If you have the devkit this **might** cause issues, was hoping we are past the devkit stage with Tango

## Find an issue?
If you find an error, see something that doesn't make intuitive sense, or know of a better way to do something in general, **please** leave a pull request or an issue
