# Chapter 0 ?

This is hopefully going to be a temporary chapter as I wawnt to eventually soon build up my own step-by-step guide to setting up a Tango project from scratch as well as a good set of templates.

**BUT FOR NOW** I will be assuming that you have gone to the [Google samples on GitHub](https://github.com/googlesamples/tango-examples-c/) and are just using one of those samples and working off that which is what I had to do

**BE CAREFUL** as these samples are **NOT** made for production and have a lot of features missing, mainly on the OpenGL side of things as well as how they combine features among each other differently and will getcha when you don't realize why it worked on that other demo, but not anymore.
