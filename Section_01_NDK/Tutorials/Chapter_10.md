## adb (Android Debug Bridge)
* adb is the main way to debug your code. It is built into Android Studios and also capable of being used from your terminal as well on the local machine
    * Open a terminal and type `adb device` and see if your device appears
* A popular command you will see is `adb logcat` which is where all your `printf()` are going
    * **Suggestion** is to use it in Android Studio  so you can filter it out and avoid the huge amount of noise
