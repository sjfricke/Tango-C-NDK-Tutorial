# Tango-C-NDK-Tutorial
Helping those who want to get involved in the realm of Augmented Reality.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
Currently still not complete with first draft, taking longer then wanted because I want it done right... hopfully by end of March this will be ready for anyone to use from start to finish

------

## Who is this for?
* Right now this is for the person who wants to get into Project Tango via the C/C++ API and found there was **NO** documentation anywhere else (seriously, this repo was start out of frustration). Our goal is to save you at least an hour of your life where we wasted five of mine trying to find these simple answers.
* **NOTE:** that this is a tutorial for both Tango and NDK and broken up to different sections if you only need help with a certain part

## Project Tango
* Project Tango is your best options to use true agumented reality technology with a plateform that many people have (Android). The support for Tango on smartphones is slowly rolling out and a great way to make AR applications that many people can use.

## Did you see something wrong?
* PLEASE PLEASE **PLEASE** correct it! I am no expert by any means and I am just trying to help with what I can. I would **LOVE** this to become a community built guide!

## Community
* I (sjfricke) started this with the attention to make this a community driven tutorial, so **we** are happy for all to help and let this grow.
