# Tango-C-NDK-Tutorial
Helping those who want to get involved in the realm of Augmented Reality

------

## Who is this for?
* Right now it is for the person who wants to get into Project Tango via the C/C++ API and found there was **NO** documentation anywhere else. My goal is to save you at least an hour of your life where I wasted five of mine trying to find these simple answer.
* Note that this is a tutorial for both Tango and NDK

## Did you see something wrong?
* PLEASE PLEASE **PLEASE** correct it! I am no expert by any means and I am just trying to help with what I can. I would **LOVE** this to become a community built guide!
