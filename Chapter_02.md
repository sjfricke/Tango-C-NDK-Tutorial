## Important Files

There are a number of important files in every NDK application that one should be aware about as they usually are the cause of the dreaded "My build won't compile for random reasons" errors.

### AndroidManifest.xml
* This is the *summary* of your whole project where you declare everything needed

### Android.mk
* This is where you list all the files you want to compile
    * If you add libraries, like tango_gl, need to inlcude its source and headers
    * Also note the flags you may need to pass (ex. -lpthreads)

### Application.mk
* The devices your applications is aimed towards
    * This is usally auto generated by the SDK manager

### build.gradle
* The order and types of tasks being executed at build time
    * Wouldn't mess with it unless you need to
