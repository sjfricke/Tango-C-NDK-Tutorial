# Chapter 4.3 - OpenGL ES part 2

In this section we are going to go through a run down of the entire graphic pipeline. **This is intended** for those with little to no knowledge to get somewhat up to speed what is going on. This also serves as a great review for those who haven't played with graphics in a while.

# Disclaimer
There are **MANY** more in depth explainations of the graphic pipeline and this is only a taste of the tip of the ice berg intended to help someone with little knowledge. This is just the information needed for someone to get their Tango app up off the ground, not for getting hired at a AAA Gaming Studio.

## The goal
When doing anything graphical the overall **goal** is take take data represented in 3-dimensions and have it so its displayed on the screen. We do this by taking data that would normally go into our RAM and used by our CPU and send it to the GPU so it can handle the task of filling in the pixels that will be displayed every frame.
