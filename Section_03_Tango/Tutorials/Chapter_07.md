# Chapter 7 - Position and Orientation
The main gem of Tango is the fact it has position data of your surrounding environment. Tango uses a value called **pose** to hold of this.

* There isn't much to really cover here as Google does a great job explaining the values of **pose** and its lifecycle in their [Pose Documentation](https://developers.google.com/tango/overview/poses)
* Make sure to understand more about the **pose** data as it will be found everywhere
