# Section 3 - Tango API
* This section is all about all the aspects of Tango API for C/C++
* The main goal of this is to get you up to speed and fill gaps not in the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/tango/apis/c/)

## What This Section Is
* An explanation of the API in general
* Overview of the 3 current API *groups*
* How to integrate into the project
* What everything does from a higher level

## What This Section Is NOT
* The API Docs already online
* A guide how to setup Tango
	* That is for [Section 4](../Section_04_Project)
* A reference for every property and function header
* A set of examples for each call (Note: this would be a cool feature to add to doc in future!)
