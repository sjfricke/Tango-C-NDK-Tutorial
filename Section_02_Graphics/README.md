# Section 2 - Graphics
* If you want to do any AR with Tango, you will need to understand a descent amount about graphics.
* If you plan to use Tango purely for its camera and sensor raw data then I guess you can skip this section.

## What This Section Is
* A rundown of what graphics Tango uses to display AR
* A brief 101 on graphics (skip sections if already know the pain of black rendered screens)
* Special graphic related info regarding the Tango
* A good spot to start if you need to learn everything about graphics

## What This Section Is NOT
* The place learn OpenGL from, plenty of better, in-depth sites for that
* Reference guide to OpenGL API calls
    
## OpenGL ES
* Since this is a Android mobile device, your only two options for graphics is OpenGL ES or Vulkan
* Vulkan is still in its implementation phase and needs Android N to run
    * Vulkan is a beast in itself and this tutorial for now will stick to OpenGL ES
